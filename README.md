# Deep Learning Final Project
Analysis of Graph Attention Networks and Graph Neural Networks in Node and Graph-Level Tasks. Compared and optimized three different graph based models - Graph Attention Network(GAT), Graph Convolution Network(GCN) and GraphSage.

Results:
 - GAT Validation Accuracy - 81%
 - GraphSage Validation Accuracy - 79%
 - GCN Validation Accuracy - 77%
 - Best optimizer for all three was ADAM
